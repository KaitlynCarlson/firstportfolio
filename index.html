            <p id="bio">I am fairly new to web development, and enrolled in the University of Washington Full-stack
                Web Developer Bootcamp. My background and experience is largely in the arts. I have a BA in English. I
                started dabbling with writing code through edX as a hobby, which I quickly became fascinated by.
                <br><br>

                To me, you see, writing code is just another language- the syntax of computers. A bit different than
                English
                but a means of communication nonetheless. For me, becoming a developer is an opportunity to use to
                language
                to create something tangible, rather than imaginative. I am excited to begin this journey, as foreign
                yet
                familiar as it may be, and explore the possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
